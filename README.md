Whoa. Just got out of Last Bullet and my brain's like a blender that lost its lid. Theater was packed, couldn't hear half the dialogue over some dude crunching popcorn like a freaking wood chipper. But somehow it added to the chaos, you know? Like life.

The movie... or was it a fever dream? The opening shot with that skyline felt like looking at an old postcard from a city I’ve never been to but miss anyway. Or maybe I was thinking about that trip to Wisconsin? Who knows. Anyway, this plot was tighter than my old pair of jeans after Thanksgiving. All those gunshots felt like they went right through the screen — maybe too realistic, my backs in knots from all the jumping.

> There was this scene, you know, in that dim bar with the neon lights? Yeah, where the hero gets another scar — felt almost poetic. The kind of melodrama that tastes like last night’s beer. I swear I saw a pigeon fly across the screen and I still can't decide if it was real or not. Could be me projecting—remember when someone asked me to download the movie? Maybe watch it again to find out if pigeons were involved.

Also, there’s that villain. His monologue felt like trying to untangle headphone cords while sleep-deprived. Mmm, maybe I'll just download, so I can actually catch what he was ranting about next time.

And that ending — what? It just ended? Like when you find an empty milk carton in the fridge. Unsatisfying but kind of perfect in its own way. Makes you think about refill or regret.

The credits rolled but the house lights didn't come on right away, probably the theater guy fell asleep, not blaming him though, felt like I was in a dream too. A restless, unkempt dream where reality and fiction play poker and you're the wild card nobody expects.
